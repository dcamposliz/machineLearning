what is machine learning?

	construct / use algorithms that learn from data
		more information > higher performance
		previous solutions > experience

		EXAMPLE
			predict the color of a square based on its edge and size
			this is a classification problem

					size		edge		color
			-------------------------------------
			1		small		dotted		green
			2		big			striped		yellow
			3		medium		normal		green

			in this case:
				features : size, edge
				label : color
				observations : rows 1,2,3

		in R, this would look like this:

			squares <- data.frame(
				size = c("small", "big", "medium")
				edge = c("dotted", "striped", "normal")
				color = c("small", "yellow", "green")
			)

			dim(squares)		#observations, #features

			str(squares)		structured overview

			summary(squares)	distribution measures


			input > FUNCTION > output

			in this case

				color ~ f(size, edge)


	machine learning IS NOT determining the most occurring color, or the average size - this is statistics

	MACHINE LEARNING GOAL = BUILDING MODELS FOR PREDICTION

we use regression for this shit!!

there are many applications that we 'know' today
